1. Soft Artistic
The header is nice and really like the hero. Since this is the first thing that people see lets not use the term Art that Breaths , please just add a very generic phrase, I don't want her to think that Im puttin gto much personality into it I want her to choose the words there. 

We are missing the Current Series section on this example.
- The current series should be 1 piece of her art work and an explanation of the series. This hsould be lorem epsum text

We need to make sure that the Selected Series Says Portfolio. Each example image should route to the categories own page with at least 4-10 other examples that you are to create with nano bannana, Make it in a similar style to her artwrok where its beach or surf themed and you can really see the brush strokes well

- Artist at the bottom , I think we should experiment witht this , lets do 3 at the bottom like this and 3 where the artist part is the hero or the first thing the user sees

Footer
- Just make this say contact. no lets create together. Include her email with a Mail icon / logo and then her instagram with a instagram icon / logo

Overall i like the cleanliness, the colors and fonts here

2. BOLD TYPOGRPHY

I thnk she will like the fon's and the font weights here. I am positive she will not like the dark colors and especically the phrase I don't just pain ti attac tthe canvas its too much.

I don't like the est 2010 

I kind of like how you did the series here , the animations the orientation and font is relaly cool
- I don't like how its dark  though by default without hovering

The process section , this is not what we want this should either be a bio or not there at all

This one is also missing current series 

Also do not use abbreviation sfor her name TK is out of the question !

I think its good you created the square buttons here to give her more of an variation of the design

3 GALLERY FOCUS

Favorite so far i think she will love seeing the brush stroke as soon as the user get there  but this shouldn't be the featured series this should still either be a bio or her name or something with a few cleawn Call to action buttons. But the art and high definition of the image is really cool as the background.

This one by far is my favorite so far.

4 CONTEMPORARY PROFESSIONAL

I think the Hero is nice but No AVAILABLE FOR COMISSION take that out andd no 15 yearss of experience. I think this is a good hero it should just show her name and a bit about herself. Same as the first use either very generic for the example or lorem epsum text

Selected series is nice but we are still missing current series there should always be a current and then her portfolio which is the past work.

The process

I think the text is nice and easy to read. Im not sure if she will want this but its good to keep something like this for an exampel and for her to keep in mind.

5. Architectural Grid.

I don't like this the Font is good but its too much maybe try to make it more subtle. more in the style that im going for , still feel free to experiment with this on the next iteration but  this is just to far away from what she want 

6. IMMERSIVE SCROLL

I like this i just htink its too dark feel free to iterate on this keep cleaning up and kind of sticking to the theeme but his one is prety cool and she may like it just brighten it up and include more art.


SUMMARY 

You're doing a good job. Remember to keep away from dark themes and anything that's too much, like in example 5. I think we're giving her a good range of examples here, but we just have a little bit more cleaning up to do. 

Make sure to Include the current Series AND Portfolio, the portfolio should lead to a page with at least 4-10 other examples that you are to create with nano bannana, Make it in a similar style to her artwrok where its beach or surf themed and you can really see the brush strokes well

=I liked what you were doing with your own thing on design 6. It just needs to be brighter. Again, my favorite one so far is exmaple 1 Soft Artistic and example 3 Gallery Focus
